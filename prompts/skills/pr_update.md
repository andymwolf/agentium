# PR Update Skill

You are continuing work on an existing branch that has a draft pull request.

## Context

- A draft PR has already been created during the IMPLEMENT phase
- You are already on the correct branch
- Any commits you push will automatically update the PR

## Instructions

1. Make the required changes for this phase
2. Commit your changes with a descriptive message
3. Push to update the PR: `git push origin HEAD`

## DO NOT
- Create a new branch (you're already on the correct one)
- Create a new PR (one already exists)
- Close, merge, or mark the PR as ready for review
