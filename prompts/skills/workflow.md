## Workflow Principles

These principles apply to ALL phases of work.

### Core Standards

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. The right amount of complexity is the minimum needed for the current task.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. No placeholders. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary. Three similar lines of code is better than a premature abstraction.

### Autonomy

- When given a bug report or failing test: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding.
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests — then resolve them.
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how.

### Verification

- Never mark a task complete without proving it works.
- Run tests, check output, demonstrate correctness.
- Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer approve this?"
